# Overview
This is an Angular todo list app I built while learning Angular. It started as a mini playground but then I got a little carried away and built a fully functional app with a REST Api backend that connects to MongoDB. I also dove into authentication and learnt about cookies and JWTs and implemented cookie authentication on the different pages as well as accounts and a login page. 

Saved here mainly for my own reference in the future, but feel free to look around.
